For simplicity, it assumes all streets have two lanes,
and all intersections are uncontrolled without traffic lights.
All streets run North-South or East-West.
The term x-y represents the location with x-coordinate x and y-coordinate y.

Cars drive on the left, as in Japan and in the UK.
At cross road intersections, the car on the right has priority.

All cars have an initial location.
The destination of a car journey is observed as an external input.
These observations trigger the car to drive, by consulting a database of known routes.
